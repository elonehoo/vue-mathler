## How to play?
You have 6 guesses to find the hidden solution. Each guess needs to be equal to the target number for the day.
After each guess, the color of the tiles changes to show how close you are to being right.

## Color rules
Green means the position and "number"/"operator" are correct,
Yellow means the position is wrong but the "number"/"operator" is correct,
Gray means neither is correct.
